		<div class="poem">
		<div class="one"> There is a place where the sidewalk ends<br>
and before the street begins,<br>
and there the grass grows soft and white,<br>
and there the sun burns crimson bright,<br>
and there the moon-bird rests from his flight<br>
to cool in the peppermint wind.<br>

		</div>
		<br>

		<div class="two">

		Let us leave this place where the smoke blows black<br>
and the dark street winds and bends.<br>
Past the pits where the asphalt flowers grow<br>
we shall walk with a walk that is measured and slow<br>
and watch where the chalk-white arrows go<br>
to the place where the sidewalk ends.<br>

		</div>
		<br>

        <div class="three">
        	Yes we'll walk with a walk that is measured and slow,<br>
and we'll go where the chalk-white arrows go,<br>
for the children, they mark, and the children, they know,<br>
the place where the sidewalk ends. <br>
        </div>
