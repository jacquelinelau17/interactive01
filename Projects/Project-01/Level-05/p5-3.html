  <h1>Where The Sidewalk Ends</h1>
   <h4>Shel Silverstein</h4>

  <div class="a box1">
  There is a place where the sidewalk ends<br>
and before the street begins,<br>
and there the grass grows soft and white,<br>

 </div>

  <div class="a box2">
  and there the sun burns crimson bright,<br>
and there the moon-bird rests from his flight<br>
to cool in the peppermint wind.<br>

  
  </div>

  <div class="a box3">

 Let us leave this place where the smoke blows black<br>
and the dark street winds and bends.<br>
Past the pits where the asphalt flowers grow<br>
  </div>


  <div class="a box4"> 
  we shall walk with a walk that is measured and slow<br>
and watch where the chalk-white arrows go<br>
to the place where the sidewalk ends.<br>
  </div>

 
  <div class="a box5">
  Yes we'll walk with a walk that is measured and slow,<br>
and we'll go where the chalk-white arrows go,<br>
for the children, they mark, and the children, they know,<br>
the place where the sidewalk ends. <br>
  </div>
