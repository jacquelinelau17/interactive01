		There<br>
		is a place<br>
		where the sidewalk<br>
		ends and before the street<br>
		begins, and there the grass grows<br>
		soft and white, and there the sun burns<br>
		crimson bright, and there the moon-bird rests<br>
		from his flight to cool in the peppermint wind.<br>
		Let us leave this place where the smoke blows black and<br>
		the dark street winds and bends. Past the pits where the asphalt<br>

		&nbsp;<br>

		<em>
		flowers grow we shall walk with a walk that is measured and slow,<br>
		and watch where the chalk-white arrows go to the place where<br>
		the sidewalk ends. Yes we'll walk with a walk that is<br>
		measured and slow, and we'll go where the<br>
		chalk-white arrows go, for the<br>
		children, they mark, and the<br>
		children, they know the<br>
		place where the<br>
		sidewalk<br>
		ends.<br>
