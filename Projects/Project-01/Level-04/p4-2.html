		There is a place where the sidewalk ends<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		And before the street begins,<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		And there the grass grows soft and white,<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		And there the sun burns crimson bright,<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		And there the moon-bird rests from his flight<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		To cool in the peppermint wind.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		Let us leave this place where the smoke blows black<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		And the dark street winds and bends.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		Past the pits where the asphalt flowers grow<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		We shall walk with a walk that is measured and slow,<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		And watch where the chalk-white arrows go<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		To the place where the sidewalk ends.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		Yes we'll walk with a walk that is measured and slow,<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		And we'll go where the chalk-white arrows go,<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		For the children, they mark, and the children, they know<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		The place where the sidewalk ends.<br>
