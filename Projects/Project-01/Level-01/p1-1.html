		there is a place where the sidewalk ends and before<br>
		the street begins, and there the grass grows soft and<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		white, and there the sun burns crimson bright, and t<br>
		here the moon-bird rests from his flight to cool in th<br>
		e peppermint wind. let us leave this place where the<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		smoke blows black and the dark street winds and be<br>
		nds. past the pits where the asphalt flowers grow we<br>
		shall walk with a walk that is measured and slow, an<br>
		d watch where the chalk-white arrows go to the plac<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		e where the sidewalk ends. yes we'll walk with a wa<br>
		lk that is measured and slow, and we'll go where the<br>
		chalk-white arrows go, for the children, they mark,<br>
		and the children, they know the place where the sid<br>
		ewalk ends.
